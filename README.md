## 🚀 New Here? Start Here!

### 1. 🐣 What is this?

AI Agents (like GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, or Cursor) are smart, but they lack specific, up-to-date knowledge about Azure services. **Skills** are folders containing markdown instructions, scripts, and resources that teach AI agents how to work with Azure services correctly, every time.

> 💡 Skills are reusable, filesystem-based resources that provide AI agents with domain-specific expertise. They load on-demand and eliminate the need to repeatedly provide the same guidance across conversations.

### 2. 📚 How These Skills Are Created

Microsoft Learn documentation already encodes **decisions, procedures, best practices, and constraints** — exactly what agents need to act effectively. Rather than relying on RAG to retrieve and summarize raw text every time, we **pre-compile this knowledge into structured, executable skills**.

**Documentation as Pre-Built Skills**: Many effective agent skills are not new inventions — they are structured patterns, workflows, and decision logic that already exist in documentation. Consider what Learn content contains:

- API patterns and usage guidance
- Service configuration procedures  
- Platform best practices and constraints
- Troubleshooting decision trees
- Security and compliance requirements

**Our approach:**

1. **Extract** high-value, task-oriented capabilities from Learn content
2. **Classify** by purpose (limits, troubleshooting, configuration, architecture, etc.)
3. **Reveal** only when relevant to the user's intent

The knowledge is **pre-compiled into actions, choices, and guardrails** the agent can use directly — not raw text that needs interpretation.

Each skill provides:
- 📚 Curated documentation links organized by topic
- 🔗 Direct access to Microsoft Learn content
- 🎯 Best practices and architecture patterns
- ⚠️ Troubleshooting guides and common pitfalls

### 3. ⚡️ Quick Start

A short path to getting started — full installation details are in the [🛠️ Installation](#️-installation) section below.

**� Plugin install (recommended):** VS Code, Claude Code, and Codex can install everything as a single agent plugin — no cloning or copying.

- **VS Code:** Command Palette → **Chat: Install Plugin From Source** → paste `https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/agent-skills`
- **Claude Code:** `/plugin marketplace add MicrosoftDocs/agent-skills`, then `/plugin install azure-agent-skills@microsoft-agent-skills`
- **Codex:** `codex plugin marketplace add MicrosoftDocs/agent-skills`, then install **azure-agent-skills** from `/plugins`

> 👉 See [⚡ One-Click Plugin Install](#-one-click-plugin-install) for full steps and the marketplace options.

**🛠️ Other assistants (manual):**

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/agent-skills.git
   ```

2. Copy the contents of the `skills/` folder to your AI assistant's skills path (see [🛠️ Installation](#️-installation) for the destination table and important notes).

3. VS Code users (manual mode): enable `chat.agent.skills` in Settings so the editor will load skills.

4. Start coding — your AI assistant will automatically discover and use the installed skills.

### 4. 🧠 How Skills Work

Skills use **progressive disclosure** to efficiently load content only when needed:

1. **Level 1 - Discovery**: Agent reads skill `name` and `description` from YAML frontmatter
2. **Level 2 - Instructions**: When triggered, agent loads the full `SKILL.md` content
3. **Level 3 - Resources**: Agent accesses additional files (scripts, examples) as needed

Once installed, just ask your AI assistant naturally:

> "Help me set up Azure Functions with Durable Functions"
> 
> "What are the best practices for Azure Container Apps?"
> 
> "How do I configure Azure API Management?"

The skills will automatically provide context from official Microsoft documentation.

## ⚡ One-Click Plugin Install

> 🚀 **Recommended.** This repository ships as a ready-to-use **[agent plugin](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/agent-customization/agent-plugins)** with native manifests for every major assistant. Install once and **all 193+ skills** are available — no cloning, no copying, no manual `skills/` setup.

### 🟦 VS Code

**Option 1 — Install directly from source**

1. Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P`).
2. Run **Chat: Install Plugin From Source**.
3. Paste the repository URL:
   ```
   https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/agent-skills
   ```
4. VS Code clones and installs the plugin. All skills now appear in **Chat: Configure Skills**.

**Option 2 — Add it as a plugin marketplace**

Register this repo as a marketplace to browse and install (and get updates) from the Extensions view.

1. Add the repository to your `chat.plugins.marketplaces` setting:
   ```jsonc
   // settings.json
   "chat.plugins.marketplaces": [
     "MicrosoftDocs/agent-skills"
   ]
   ```
2. Open the **Extensions** view (`Ctrl+Shift+X`) and search `@agentPlugins`.
3. Find **azure-agent-skills** and select **Install**.

> ⚠️ **Preview feature.** Agent plugins require `chat.plugins.enabled` to be set to `true`. This setting may be managed by your organization. If you don't see the option, ask your administrator or use the [manual installation](#️-installation) below.

### 🟣 Claude Code

Claude Code installs this repo as a plugin through its marketplace. From within Claude Code:

1. Add this repository as a marketplace:
   ```
   /plugin marketplace add MicrosoftDocs/agent-skills
   ```
2. Install the plugin:
   ```
   /plugin install azure-agent-skills@microsoft-agent-skills
   ```
3. Run `/reload-plugins` (or restart Claude Code) to activate. All skills are now available.

### 🟢 OpenAI Codex

Codex installs this repo as a plugin through its plugin browser. From the Codex CLI:

1. Add this repository as a marketplace:
   ```
   codex plugin marketplace add MicrosoftDocs/agent-skills
   ```
2. Open the plugin browser and install **azure-agent-skills** from the **microsoft-agent-skills** marketplace:
   ```
   /plugins
   ```
3. Restart Codex if the skills don't appear immediately.

> 💡 **One repo, every tool.** The same repository ships native plugin manifests for each ecosystem — [`plugin.json`](plugin.json) (VS Code / Copilot CLI), [`.claude-plugin/`](.claude-plugin/) (Claude Code), and [`.codex-plugin/`](.codex-plugin/) + [`.agents/plugins/`](.agents/plugins/) (Codex) — so a single install gets you all skills wherever you work.

---

## 🛠️ Installation

Choose the installation path based on your preferred AI coding assistant.

### ⚡ Option A: Install as an Agent Plugin (Recommended)

The fastest, zero-maintenance path — install once and get all skills, with built-in updates. Works in **VS Code**, **Claude Code**, and **OpenAI Codex**. See [⚡ One-Click Plugin Install](#-one-click-plugin-install) for full details.

- **VS Code (from source):** Command Palette → **Chat: Install Plugin From Source** → paste `https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/agent-skills`.
- **VS Code (marketplace):** add `"MicrosoftDocs/agent-skills"` to `chat.plugins.marketplaces`, then install **azure-agent-skills** from the Extensions view (`@agentPlugins`).
- **Claude Code:** `/plugin marketplace add MicrosoftDocs/agent-skills`, then `/plugin install azure-agent-skills@microsoft-agent-skills`.
- **OpenAI Codex:** `codex plugin marketplace add MicrosoftDocs/agent-skills`, then install **azure-agent-skills** from `/plugins`.

> ⚠️ In VS Code, this requires the agent plugins preview (`chat.plugins.enabled` set to `true`). If unavailable, use Option B below.

---

### 📋 Option B: Manual Install (All Assistants)

> ⚠️ **Note:** This repository contains skills in the `skills/` subdirectory. Clone the repo first, then copy the skills to your target location.

#### Step 1: Clone the Repository

First, clone this repository to a location on your machine (e.g., your home folder or a temp directory):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/agent-skills.git
```

#### Step 2: Copy Skills to Your Destination

Copy the **contents** inside the `skills/` folder to your target location based on your AI assistant:

| AI Assistant | Project-level (in your repo) | Personal/Global (all projects) |
|--------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **GitHub Copilot** | `{your-project}/.github/skills/` | `~/.copilot/skills/` |
| **Claude Code** | `{your-project}/.claude/skills/` | `~/.claude/skills/` |
| **OpenAI Codex** | `{your-project}/.codex/skills/` | `~/.codex/skills/` |
| **Cursor** | `{your-project}/.cursor/skills/` | — |
| **Gemini CLI** | `{your-project}/.gemini/skills/` | — |
| **Antigravity IDE** | `{your-project}/.agent/skills/` | `~/.gemini/antigravity/skills/` |
| **OpenCode** | `{your-project}/.agent/skills/` | `~/.agent/skills/` |
| **AdaL CLI** | `{your-project}/.adal/skills/` | `~/.adal/skills/` |

> ⚠️ **Important:** Copy the folders **inside** `skills/` (e.g., `azure-functions/`, `azure-container-apps/`), NOT the `skills` folder itself.
>
> ✅ Correct: `.copilot/skills/azure-functions/SKILL.md`  
> ❌ Wrong: `.copilot/skills/skills/azure-functions/SKILL.md`

> 💡 **Path Note:** `~` = Home directory
> - **Windows:** `C:\Users\yourname` (use `$HOME` in PowerShell)
> - **macOS/Linux:** `/Users/yourname` or `/home/yourname`

**Enable Agent Skills in VS Code** (Required for the manual install above):

> 💡 Using the [agent plugin](#-one-click-plugin-install) (Option A)? You can skip this — the plugin loads its skills automatically once `chat.plugins.enabled` is on.

Agent Skills is currently an **experimental feature**. For the manual copy method, you must enable it manually:

1. Open VS Code Settings (`Ctrl`+`,` on Windows/Linux, `Cmd`+`,` on macOS)
2. Search for `chat.agent.skills`
3. Check the box for **"Chat: Use Agent Skills"**
   ![vs-code-use-agent-skills](docs/vs-code-use-agent-skills.png)

> ⚠️ **Important:** Without this setting enabled, VS Code will not load or use any skills!

---

#### Step 3: Cleanup (Optional)

After copying, you can delete the cloned `agent-skills` repository if you no longer need it.

---
