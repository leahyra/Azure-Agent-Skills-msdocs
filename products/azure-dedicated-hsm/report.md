## Classified Pages

| TOC Title | Type | Confidence | Reason |
|-----------|------|------------|--------|
| [Migrate to Cloud or Managed HSM](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dedicated-hsm/migration-guide) | decision-making | 0.80 | Provides concrete migration guidance, including that keys cannot be migrated and must be recreated, timelines, restrictions, and when to choose Azure Cloud HSM vs Azure Managed HSM. This is explicit decision and migration planning content with product-specific constraints. |
| [Secure your Dedicated HSM](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dedicated-hsm/secure-dedicated-hsm) | security | 0.80 | Provides product-specific security recommendations for network security, identity management, monitoring, and backup tailored to Dedicated HSM, going beyond generic security advice into concrete patterns for this service. |
| [Troubleshooting](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dedicated-hsm/troubleshoot) | troubleshooting | 0.80 | Explicitly a troubleshooting article that distinguishes Azure-side registration/deployment from HSM configuration, and covers unique considerations arising from HSMs as Azure resources. It maps service-specific issues to causes and resolutions. |
| [Migrate ExpressRoute Gateway Basic SKU public IP to Standard SKU public IP](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dedicated-hsm/migration-basic-standard) | deployment | 0.70 | Contains SKU-specific support timeline (Basic SKU public IP support extended to March 2027) and a required migration pattern (no smooth migration; must create new HSM/VNET/ERGW with Standard SKU). These are deployment constraints and SKU-specific requirements. |
| [Dedicated HSM overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dedicated-hsm/overview) | decision-making | 0.65 | Contains product-specific retirement timeline (support until July 31, 2028), explicit onboarding restrictions, and concrete guidance to choose Azure Cloud HSM vs Azure Managed HSM. This is decision guidance tied to specific dates and migration direction that an LLM is unlikely to know from training. |
| [Frequently asked questions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dedicated-hsm/faq) | troubleshooting | 0.65 | FAQ pages for specialized services like Azure Dedicated HSM typically include product-specific behaviors, support boundaries, and interoperability details (for example, supported configurations, failover behavior, and support policies) that are not generic knowledge. These are often framed as specific questions and answers about symptoms or operational edge cases, aligning best with troubleshooting, even if not organized strictly by error code. |
| [Deciding on deployment architecture](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dedicated-hsm/deployment-architecture) | architecture-patterns | 0.60 | Discusses when customers benefit from Dedicated HSM, how devices are distributed across datacenters, pairing for HA, and cross-region deployment for disaster resilience. These are product-specific architectural deployment patterns. |
| [High availability](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dedicated-hsm/high-availability) | architecture-patterns | 0.60 | Discusses how Microsoft deploys HSMs across datacenters and how to pair devices within a region for HA and across regions for resilience. These are product-specific HA patterns and placement behaviors that go beyond generic HA concepts. |
| [Physical security](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dedicated-hsm/physical-security) | security | 0.60 | Describes how Dedicated HSM devices are managed through their lifecycle to meet stringent security requirements. This is product-specific physical security posture information not derivable from generic security knowledge. |
| [Networking](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dedicated-hsm/networking) | architecture-patterns | 0.55 | Covers networking considerations for different deployment scenarios (on-prem connectivity, distributed apps, HA configurations) with product-specific guidance on secure network design for Dedicated HSM, which is architectural rather than generic networking theory. |
