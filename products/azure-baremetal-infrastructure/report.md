## Classified Pages

| TOC Title | Type | Confidence | Reason |
|-----------|------|------------|--------|
| [Available Regions and SKUs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/baremetal-infrastructure/workloads/nc2-on-azure/available-regions-skus) | decision-making | 0.74 | Page lists which Azure regions support Nutanix Cloud Clusters and which specific Ready Node/SKU types are available per region. This is product- and SKU-specific availability data that changes over time and isn't inferable from general training. It directly supports deployment and capacity planning decisions (which region/SKU combinations can be used), fitting the decision-making category better than limits-quotas since it focuses on availability matrices rather than numeric resource limits. |
| [Architecture](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/baremetal-infrastructure/workloads/nc2-on-azure/architecture) | architecture-patterns | 0.65 | Describes architectural components and several configurations of NC2 on Azure; likely includes product-specific topology patterns and when to use particular configurations, which are not generic concepts. |

## Unclassified Pages

| TOC Title | Confidence | Reason |
|-----------|------------|--------|
| [FAQ](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/baremetal-infrastructure/workloads/nc2-on-azure/faq) | 0.40 | FAQ format; summary does not indicate presence of specific error codes, configuration tables, or numeric limits—likely general Q&A rather than deep technical reference. |
| [Connect BareMetal instances in Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/baremetal-infrastructure/connect-baremetal-infrastructure) | 0.30 | Described as showing what you can do in the portal/CLI; appears to be a usage/navigation guide rather than detailed configuration or limits. |
| [Know the terms](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/baremetal-infrastructure/know-baremetal-terms) | 0.30 | Defines terminology (stamp, revision, etc.) but lacks numeric limits, configuration parameters, or troubleshooting mappings. |
| [About Nutanix Cloud Clusters on Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/baremetal-infrastructure/workloads/nc2-on-azure/about-nc2-on-azure) | 0.20 | Overview of NC2 on Azure benefits and features; no indication of numeric thresholds, decision matrices, or detailed configuration. |
| [Get started](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/baremetal-infrastructure/workloads/nc2-on-azure/get-started) | 0.20 | Page is a getting-started guide for Nutanix Cloud Clusters on Azure, focused on sign-up and initial setup. It does not expose detailed limits, configuration parameter tables, error-code-based troubleshooting, or other product-specific expert details as defined by the sub-skill types. |
| [What is BareMetal Infrastructure?](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/baremetal-infrastructure/concepts-baremetal-infrastructure-overview) | 0.20 | High-level overview of Azure BareMetal Infrastructure; no concrete limits, configuration tables, error codes, or product-specific settings. |
