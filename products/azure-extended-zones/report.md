## Classified Pages

| TOC Title | Type | Confidence | Reason |
|-----------|------|------------|--------|
| [Create a custom Azure Policy in an Extended Zone](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/extended-zones/create-azure-policy) | configuration | 0.80 | Explains that only custom policies are supported and references specific policy fields like extendedLocation, extendedLocation.name, and extendedLocation.type; these are product-specific configuration parameters. |
| [Encrypt disks with customer-managed keys in an Azure Extended Zone](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/extended-zones/key-vault-encrypt-azure-extended-zone-disk) | security | 0.80 | Describes how to use Key Vault and Disk Encryption Sets specifically for Extended Zones, including the constraint that assigning a DES is currently supported only via CLI; this is product-specific security configuration behavior. |
| [Request access to an Extended Zone](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/extended-zones/request-access) | configuration | 0.70 | Describes explicit subscription registration requirements and likely includes specific PowerShell/CLI commands and parameter names (for extendedLocation registration), which are product-specific configuration details. |
| [Request quota increase](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/extended-zones/request-quota-increase) | limits-quotas | 0.70 | A quota-increase article for a specific Azure service is typically driven by concrete per-SKU or per-region numeric limits and quota values that aren't generally known; even if focused on the request flow, it necessarily references product-specific quota concepts, so it best fits the limits-quotas category. |
| [Deploy Azure Firewall in an Extended Zone (Preview)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/extended-zones/deploy-azure-firewall) | configuration | 0.68 | The article includes ARM template snippets and specific routing and firewall rule configuration details for Azure Firewall in Azure Extended Zones. These are product-specific configuration patterns and parameters (template properties, routing setup, validation steps) that go beyond generic deployment guidance and represent expert knowledge about how this service must be configured in this specialized environment. |
| [Purchase reservations and savings plans](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/extended-zones/purchase-reservations-savings-plans) | decision-making | 0.65 | Covers when and how to use reservations vs savings plans for Extended Zones, with meter support constraints and timing (for example, support by end of 2025); this is product-specific cost/plan selection guidance. |

## Unclassified Pages

|-----------|------------|--------|
| [Deploy a storage account in an Extended Zone](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/extended-zones/create-storage-account) | 0.40 | Tutorial for creating a storage account in an extended zone; likely basic wizard steps without configuration matrices or quotas specific enough to qualify. |
| [Deploy an AKS cluster in an Extended Zone](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/extended-zones/deploy-aks-cluster) | 0.30 | Appears to be a step-by-step tutorial for deploying AKS in Extended Zones via the portal; summary does not indicate presence of configuration parameter tables, limits, decision matrices, or error-code-based troubleshooting. Likely standard how-to content rather than expert reference details. |
| [Extended Zones FAQ](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/extended-zones/faq) | 0.30 | FAQ-style content but summary does not indicate specific error codes, limits, or configuration tables; likely conceptual and eligibility/usage Q&A. |
| [Replicate images with Azure Compute Gallery](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/extended-zones/replicate-azure-compute-gallery) | 0.30 | Tutorial for replicating 3rd-party images; while it mentions a special workflow and support contact, it does not clearly indicate detailed configuration parameters, limits, or decision matrices. |
| [Back up a virtual machine](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/extended-zones/backup-virtual-machine) | 0.20 | Tutorial for backing up a VM; summary suggests procedural portal steps without specific backup limits, quotas, or detailed configuration parameter tables. |
| [ContainerApps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/extended-zones/arc-enabled-workloads-container-apps) | 0.20 | Tutorial-style deployment of Arc-enabled Container Apps in an Extended Zone; summary suggests procedural guidance rather than detailed configuration matrices, limits, or troubleshooting content, so no strong expert-knowledge signal for the defined sub-skill types. |
