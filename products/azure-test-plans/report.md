## Classified Pages

| TOC Title | Type | Confidence | Reason |
|-----------|------|------------|--------|
| [Add custom data fields](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/test/custom-fields?view=azure-devops) | limits-quotas | 0.70 | Explicitly states a numeric limit: up to 100 custom fields per Azure DevOps project; this is a concrete quota not generally known from training. |
| [Default permissions (Security)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/test/manual-test-permissions?view=azure-devops) | security | 0.70 | Covers Azure DevOps access levels, licensing, and permissions for manual and exploratory testing. Likely includes specific permission names, role mappings, and access requirements, which are product-specific security/authorization details. |
| [Manual testing FAQs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/test/reference-qa?view=azure-devops) | limits-quotas | 0.70 | FAQ for Azure Test Plans typically includes concrete retention durations and possibly other numeric constraints (for example, how long test results are kept, limits around test artifacts). These are product-specific limits that an LLM is unlikely to know precisely from training, fitting the limits-quotas category better than the others. |
| [Test case management commands](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/test/test-case-managment-reference?view=azure-devops) | integrations | 0.70 | Reference for tcm.exe command-line tool, which is a product-specific integration/automation interface. Such pages typically list commands, arguments, and options (API-like parameters) unique to Azure Test Plans, matching the integrations & coding patterns criteria. |
