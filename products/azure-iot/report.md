## Classified Pages

| TOC Title | Type | Confidence | Reason |
|-----------|------|------------|--------|
| [Best practices for namespaces](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot/iot-device-registry-namespace-guidance) | decision-making | 0.72 | The article is explicitly about how to design namespaces and decide when to create new ones versus reuse existing ones. This is service-specific decision guidance about organizational boundaries and solution design, not just conceptual overview. It helps users choose between options for namespace layout in real deployments, which aligns with the decision-making sub-skill. While the summary doesn't show numeric thresholds, the focus on concrete 'when to' guidance for this specific service indicates expert, product-specific decision criteria. |
| [Best practices for schema registries](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot/iot-device-registry-schema-registry-guidance) | decision-making | 0.70 | The page focuses on how to design schema registries and decide when to create or reuse them in an Azure IoT Operations solution. This is product-specific guidance on organizing schemas across cloud and edge, helping users choose between alternative designs. That fits the decision-making category, as it provides concrete 'when to choose which registry strategy' advice rather than just describing what a schema registry is. |
| [Connect on-premises SAP system to Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot/howto-connect-on-premises-sap-to-azure) | integrations | 0.70 | Step-by-step integration of SAP ERP via OPC UA and Azure; product-specific integration architecture and configuration details. |
| [Enable industrial dataspace in Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot/howto-iot-industrial-dataspaces) | architecture-patterns | 0.60 | Describes how to build an industrial dataspace using Azure and open-source implementations; architecture-specific guidance for secure data exchange. |
| [Implement industrial IoT reference solution](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot/tutorial-iot-industrial-solution-architecture) | architecture-patterns | 0.60 | Reference architecture for industrial IoT with specific use cases (OEE, forecasting, anomaly detection); likely includes Azure-service-specific architectural patterns and components. |

## Unclassified Pages

| TOC Title | Confidence | Reason |
|-----------|------------|--------|
| [Secure your solution](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot/iot-overview-security) | 0.30 | Security overview and best practices at a high level; summary does not indicate specific RBAC roles, config values, or compliance settings. |
| [Choose an Azure IoT service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot/iot-services-and-technologies) | 0.20 | Describes available Azure IoT services; appears as catalog/overview without detailed decision matrices or quantified comparisons. |
| [IoT device development](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot/iot-overview-device-development) | 0.10 | Overview of IoT device development concepts and components; does not expose concrete configuration tables, quotas, error mappings, or product-specific best-practice details. |
| [Support and help options](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot/iot-support-help) | 0.10 | Support and help options; meta-information, not technical configuration or troubleshooting content. |
| [What is Azure IoT?](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot/iot-introduction) | 0.10 | High-level introduction to Azure IoT portfolio and concepts without specific limits, configuration parameters, error codes, or decision matrices. |
| [IoT glossary](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot/iot-glossary) | - | Glossary of IoT terms is conceptual reference, not expert configuration, limits, troubleshooting, or decision-making content. |
