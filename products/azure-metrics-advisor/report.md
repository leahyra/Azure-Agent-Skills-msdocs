|-----------|------|------------|--------|
| [Metrics Advisor FAQ](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/metrics-advisor/faq) | limits-quotas | 0.78 | The FAQ includes concrete, product-specific limits such as maximum number of metrics, series, and alerts per resource, as well as constraints on ingestion frequency and data latency. These are exact numerical limits and quotas that are unlikely to be reliably known from training data and match the limits-quotas criteria. |
| [Use customer-managed keys](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/metrics-advisor/encryption) | security | 0.75 | Encryption article for data at rest and authentication flows; likely includes specific encryption behavior, key usage, and authentication configuration details unique to Metrics Advisor, matching security sub-skill criteria. |
| [Configure metrics and fine tune detection configuration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/metrics-advisor/how-tos/configure-metrics) | configuration | 0.70 | Explicitly about configuring the instance and fine-tuning anomaly detection; such pages usually expose named settings, thresholds, and allowed values, matching configuration. |
| [Connect different data sources](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/metrics-advisor/data-feeds-from-different-sources) | integrations | 0.70 | Describes connecting different data sources with multiple authentication flows; such pages typically list connection string formats and auth parameters per source, fitting integrations & coding patterns. |
| [Create a credential entity](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/metrics-advisor/how-tos/credential-entity) | security | 0.65 | Covers credential entities for Azure SQL connection strings and service principals; likely includes specific authentication types, fields, and secure storage behavior that are product-specific security configuration details. |
| [REST API and client libraries](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/metrics-advisor/quickstarts/rest-api-and-client-library) | integrations | 0.65 | Quickstart for REST API and client libraries typically includes SDK method signatures, request parameters, and authentication configuration specific to Metrics Advisor, which fits integrations & coding patterns. |
| [Cost management](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/metrics-advisor/cost-management) | decision-making | 0.60 | Cost management/pricing page typically includes tiered pricing, metering units, and usage guidance; these quantified trade-offs help decide how to use the service and manage capacity, fitting decision-making. |
