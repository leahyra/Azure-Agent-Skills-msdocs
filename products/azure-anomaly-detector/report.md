## Classified Pages

| TOC Title | Type | Confidence | Reason |
|-----------|------|------------|--------|
| [Configure containers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/anomaly-detector/anomaly-detector-container-configuration) | configuration | 0.95 | Explicitly about configuring the container via docker run arguments; includes required and optional settings and container-specific billing parameters—classic configuration table content. |
| [Error codes (multivariate)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/anomaly-detector/concepts/troubleshoot) | troubleshooting | 0.95 | Explicit troubleshooting article mapping common error messages to remediation steps for the multivariate API—classic symptom → cause → solution content. |
| [Service limits](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/anomaly-detector/service-limits) | limits-quotas | 0.95 | Explicitly described as a quotas and limits article for all pricing tiers; these numeric limits and tier-specific constraints are expert knowledge not reliably known from training. |

| [FAQ](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/anomaly-detector/faq) | troubleshooting | 0.78 | The FAQ is described as containing answers to frequently asked troubleshooting questions for the Anomaly Detector service, which typically includes symptom-to-solution mappings and product-specific guidance beyond generic concepts. |
| [Install and run containers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/anomaly-detector/anomaly-detector-container-howto) | deployment | 0.70 | Covers installing and running Anomaly Detector as Docker containers on-premises; includes container image locations and runtime requirements, which are deployment-specific. |

## Unclassified Pages

| TOC Title | Confidence | Reason |
|-----------|------------|--------|
| [Region support details](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/anomaly-detector/regions) | 0.40 | Lists available regions and endpoints; while specific, this is more of a location/endpoint catalog than a configuration, limits, or decision-making guide as defined by the sub-skill types. |
| [Batch inference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/anomaly-detector/how-to/batch-inference) | 0.30 | How-to for triggering batch inference; primarily procedural usage instructions rather than expert configuration, limits, or troubleshooting mappings. |
| [Client libraries (multivariate)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/anomaly-detector/quickstarts/client-libraries-multivariate) | 0.30 | Multivariate quickstart for client library; focuses on getting started, not on expert configuration, limits, or troubleshooting matrices. |
