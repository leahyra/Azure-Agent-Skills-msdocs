## Classified Pages

| TOC Title | Type | Confidence | Reason |
|-----------|------|------------|--------|
| [Firmware analysis role-based access control](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/firmware-analysis/firmware-analysis-rbac) | security | 0.80 | RBAC article will list specific roles, scopes, and permission mappings for firmware analysis resources, matching the security sub-skill criteria. |
| [Analyze firmware images using a Python script](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/firmware-analysis/quickstart-upload-firmware-using-python) | integrations | 0.70 | Python quickstart necessarily documents API endpoints, request payloads, and parameter usage specific to the firmware analysis service, fitting integrations & coding patterns. |
| [Automate firmware analysis using service principals](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/firmware-analysis/automate-firmware-analysis-service-principals) | security | 0.70 | Describes creating and using service principals with appropriate permissions for firmware analysis automation, including auth configuration details, fitting the security category. |
| [Interpreting extractor paths from analysis results](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/firmware-analysis/interpreting-extractor-paths) | best-practices | 0.70 | The page teaches how to interpret extractor paths in the SBOM view for nested file systems and compressed images. This is detailed, product-specific guidance on reading this tool’s output correctly (how paths map to embedded file systems and components), which is actionable usage advice and thus fits best-practices. |
| [Understanding and prioritizing weaknesses data in firmware analysis](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/firmware-analysis/understand-weaknesses-data) | best-practices | 0.70 | The page explains how to interpret multiple weakness-related fields in firmware analysis results and how to evaluate them together to prioritize risk. That is product-specific guidance on how to use this service’s data correctly (how to read CVE view, how to weigh signals), which fits best-practices rather than generic security theory. |
| [Analyze firmware images using Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/firmware-analysis/quickstart-upload-firmware-using-azure-command-line-interface) | integrations | 0.65 | Quickstart for Azure CLI typically includes specific command parameters, flags, and required values unique to the firmware analysis service, matching integration & coding pattern criteria. |
| [Analyze firmware images using Azure PowerShell](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/firmware-analysis/quickstart-upload-firmware-using-powershell) | integrations | 0.65 | PowerShell quickstart will contain cmdlet names and parameter sets specific to firmware analysis, which are concrete integration details beyond generic SDK usage. |
| [FAQ](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/firmware-analysis/firmware-analysis-faq) | troubleshooting | 0.65 | FAQ pages for a niche service typically include product-specific behaviors, limitations, and answers to concrete operational questions (for example, what certain results mean, supported formats, or how long analysis takes). These are troubleshooting-style symptom→explanation mappings that go beyond generic concepts, so they qualify as expert knowledge even though the summary doesn’t list specific error codes. |
| [Create a firmware workspace using ARM templates](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/firmware-analysis/quickstart-firmware-analysis-arm) | deployment | 0.60 | ARM template quickstart defines resource schemas and required properties for firmware analysis workspaces, which are product-specific deployment details. |
