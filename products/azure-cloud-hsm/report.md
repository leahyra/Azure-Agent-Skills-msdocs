| [Secure your Cloud HSM](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-hsm/secure-cloud-hsm) | best-practices | 0.80 | Article explicitly provides security recommendations and best practices for Azure Cloud HSM, likely including product-specific guidance (for example, role usage, network isolation, key management patterns) that go beyond generic security concepts. |
| [Supported cryptographic algorithms](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-hsm/supported-algorithms) | limits-quotas | 0.80 | Lists exactly which algorithms, modes, and key lengths/curves are supported by the hardware, which are concrete capability limits not generally known. |
| [User Management](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-hsm/user-management) | security | 0.80 | User management best practices for Cloud HSM are security-focused and likely detail role restrictions, credential handling, and redundancy patterns specific to the service. |
| [Key Management and Security](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-hsm/key-management) | best-practices | 0.76 | The page provides detailed recommendations for key management in Azure Cloud HSM, including handling storage limits, wrapping security, attributes, and caching. These are product-specific DO/DON'T patterns and configuration-style guidance, matching best-practices; storage limits aspects may also touch limits-quotas but the primary focus is prescriptive management guidance. |
| [Authentication](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-hsm/authentication) | security | 0.75 | Describes authentication methods (CLI, PKCS#11, JCE, OpenSSL) and best practices, implying product-specific auth configuration and secure session handling guidance. |
