## Classified Pages

| TOC Title | Type | Confidence | Reason |
|-----------|------|------------|--------|
| [Azure Route Server Capacity](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/route-server/route-server-capacity) | limits-quotas | 0.90 | Provides explicit numeric capacity values (e.g., default 2 units, 4,000 VMs, 1,000-VM increments) that are product-specific limits. |
| [Troubleshoot Route Server issues](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/route-server/troubleshoot-route-server) | troubleshooting | 0.80 | Explicitly a troubleshooting article for Azure Route Server. Such pages normally include specific symptoms, causes, and resolutions, often with Azure-specific diagnostics, commands, and possibly error messages. This matches the troubleshooting sub-skill definition and constitutes expert operational knowledge. |
| [IP anycast](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/route-server/anycast) | architecture-patterns | 0.75 | Covers a specific anycast routing pattern over private networks using Route Server, including when to use it for availability/performance. |
| [Multi-region design](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/route-server/multiregion) | architecture-patterns | 0.75 | Provides multi-region topology patterns and design guidance specific to Route Server, including HA and DR scenarios. |
| [Configure and manage Route Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/route-server/configure-route-server) | configuration | 0.70 | Article is about configuring and managing Azure Route Server via portal, PowerShell, and CLI, including adding/removing BGP peers and configuring route exchange and routing preferences. This typically involves specific parameter names, flags, and configuration options unique to Route Server, which qualifies as expert configuration knowledge beyond generic concepts. |
| [Dual-homed network](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/route-server/about-dual-homed-network) | architecture-patterns | 0.70 | Describes a specific dual-homed network architecture pattern using Azure Route Server, including when and why to use it. |
| [Next hop IP support](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/route-server/next-hop-ip) | architecture-patterns | 0.70 | Describes product-specific architectural patterns (active-passive, active-active behind internal load balancers) enabled by next hop IP support. |
| [Path selection](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/route-server/path-selection) | best-practices | 0.70 | Explains how to configure routing preferences for performance/cost/resilience with product-specific guidance on path selection. |
| [Roles and permissions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/route-server/roles-permissions) | security | 0.70 | Focuses on RBAC roles and permissions required for Route Server, likely listing specific role names and scopes. |
